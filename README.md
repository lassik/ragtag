# Ragtag

Ragtag is a music tagger based on two principles:

* **Design for a messy world.** Automatic tagging based on a neat
  central database is doomed to fail for a large and diverse music
  collection. Mismatches and missing entries are both very common
  (especially for electronic, classical and non-Western music).
  Auto-tagging is a useful guide but a bad foundation.

* **Design to minimize tedium and error.** It's not useful to just
  give the user free-text fields. Most tag editing is not free-text
  editing - it's fixing a few predictable kinds of error such as
  incorrect capitalization or numbering. Use color liberally to draw
  attention to odd-looking data, and use the mouse to reduce cognitive
  load.
